# Assignment 0: Least Squares and Probability Theory

## Overview

This foundational assignment introduces core mathematical concepts that underpin estimation and control methods used throughout the course. While **not graded** (0 points), completing this assignment demonstrates mastery of fundamental estimation theory and may be considered in final grade determinations if needed.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, students will:

1. **Apply Least Squares Estimation**: Use least squares methods to estimate parameters from noisy data
3. **Analyze Real-World Data**: Work with geological data to solve a practical estimation problem
4. **Quantify Uncertainty**: Compute and interpret estimation uncertainty
5. **Validate Models**: Assess model fit and residual analysis

## Problem Description

### The Pacific Plate Velocity Problem

You will estimate the velocity of the Pacific tectonic plate using volcanic island age and distance data. As the Pacific Plate moves over a stationary mantle hotspot (currently under Hawaii), it creates a chain of volcanic islands. By analyzing the age and distance of these islands from the hotspot, you can estimate the plate's velocity.

**Physical Model:**
```
distance = velocity × age + noise
```

Your task is to:
1. Estimate the plate velocity using least squares
2. Compute the uncertainty in your estimate
3. Validate your model against the data
4. Interpret your results in a geological context

## Tips for Success

### Data Analysis

3. Verify units are consistent
4. Document any data preprocessing

### Least Squares Implementation
1. Start with the mathematical derivation
2. Verify matrix dimensions
3. Implement manually first, and then explore numpy.linalg.lstsq() to compare 
4. Check for numerical stability

### Uncertainty Analysis
1. Don't forget to estimate noise variance
2. Propagate uncertainty properly
3. Report confidence intervals with your estimate
4. Visualize uncertainty on your plots

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Forgetting to include intercept term
- ❌ Mixing units (years vs. millions of years)
- ❌ Not validating assumptions
- ❌ Ignoring outliers without justification
- ❌ Over-interpreting results

## Example Code Structure

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# 1. Load data
data = pd.read_csv('volcanoes_data_ses598_2026.csv')
age = data['age'].values  # Example column name
distance = data['distance'].values  # Example column name

# 2. Formulate problem
# y = H * x + noise
# where y = distance, x = [velocity, offset]^T

# 3. Least squares solution
# x_hat = (H^T H)^-1 H^T y

# 4. Compute covariance
# P = sigma^2 (H^T H)^-1

# 5. Validate model
# residuals = y - H * x_hat
# Plot residuals, compute R^2, etc.

# 6. Visualize results
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(age, distance, label='Data')
# Plot your fitted line
plt.xlabel('Age (millions of years)')
plt.ylabel('Distance from hotspot (km)')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

## Theoretical Background

### Least Squares Estimation

Given a linear model: **y = Hx + ν**

Where:
- **y**: measurements (n × 1)
- **H**: observation matrix (n × m)
- **x**: parameters to estimate (m × 1)
- **ν**: zero-mean Gaussian noise

The least squares estimate minimizes: ||**y** - **Hx**||²

**Solution:** **x̂** = (**H**ᵀ**H**)⁻¹**H**ᵀ**y**

**Covariance:** **P** = σ²(**H**ᵀ**H**)⁻¹

where σ² is the noise variance (estimated from residuals)

### Maximum Likelihood Estimation

If noise is Gaussian: **ν** ~ N(0, σ²**I**)

Then the MLE is equivalent to the least squares estimate!

This connects probability theory to optimization.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Do I need to submit this assignment?
**A:** No formal submission required, but keeping your work organized is recommended for your own learning and potential future reference.

### Q: How much time should I spend on this?
**A:** 2-4 hours for implementation and analysis. Focus on understanding concepts over perfection.

### Q: Can I use built-in least squares functions?
**A:** Yes! Using `numpy.linalg.lstsq()` or `scipy.optimize.least_squares()` is fine. Understanding the math is what matters.

### Q: What if I get a different velocity than expected?
**A:** That's okay! Focus on your methodology. If you're far off, check your units and formulation.

### Q: Should I include an intercept term?
**A:** Yes, generally a good idea. The model becomes: distance = velocity × age + offset

### Q: How do I handle outliers?
**A:** You can identify outliers using residual analysis. Discuss them in your write-up but be careful about blindly removing data.

### Q: Can I work in groups?
**A:** Discussion is encouraged, but everyone should implement their own solution.

## Why This Assignment Matters

Estimation theory is fundamental to robotics and AI:

- **State Estimation**: Where is my robot? (Kalman filters, particle filters)
- **Mapping**: What does the environment look like? (SLAM, structure from motion)
- **Learning**: What are the model parameters? (Neural networks, system ID)
